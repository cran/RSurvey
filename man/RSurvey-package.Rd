\note{
The \pkg{RSurvey} \acronym{GUI} requires \R operate as an \acronym{SDI} 
application, using multiple top-level windows for the console, graphics, and 
pager. Files can be one of four types as indicated by their extension: 
tables (\file{.txt}, \file{.csv}, \file{.dat}, or \file{.shp}), 
grids (\file{.grd}), polygons (\file{.ply}), or project images (\file{.rda}). 
Tables (\file{.txt}, \file{.csv}, \file{.dat}) can be compressed by \code{gzip} 
with additional extension \file{.gz}. Shapefiles (\file{.shp}) and interpolated 
grid files (\file{.grd}) are limited to data export. Support for programmatic 
manipulation of measurement units is only provided for date and time values; 
therefore, the bulk of unit consistency is tasked to the user. 
Time zones, spatial datum's and projections are not supported.

The set of standards used for coding \pkg{RSurvey} is documented in 
\emph{Google's R Style Guide}, 
\url{http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/google-r-style.html}.
