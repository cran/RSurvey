\title{Plot Interpolated Surface using OpenGL}

\description{
A three-dimensional (\acronym{3D}) surface plot of the processed survey data is drawn.
}

\usage{
plotSurvey3d(x=NULL, y=NULL, z=NULL, px=NULL, py=NULL, pz=NULL, 
vasp = NA, hasp = NA, width = 7, ppi = 96, cex.pts=1, 
mouseMode = c("trackball", "zAxis", "zoom"), bg = "white")
}

\arguments{
\item{x, y}{numeric; locations of grid lines at which the values in z are measured. These must be in ascending order. If \code{x} is a list, its components \code{x$x} and \code{x$y} are used for \code{x} and \code{y}, respectively. If the list has component \code{x$z} this is used for \code{z}.}
\item{z}{matrix; the values to be plotted.}
\item{px}{numeric; a vector of \code{x} coordinates for points in the plot. If \code{px} is a list, its components \code{px$px}, \code{px$py} and \code{px$pz} are used for \code{px}, \code{py} and \code{pz}, respectively.}
\item{py}{numeric; a vector of \code{y} coordinates for points in the plot}
\item{pz}{numeric; a vector of \code{z} coordinates for points in the plot}
\item{vasp}{numeric; the \code{z/x} aspect ratio}
\item{hasp}{numeric; the \code{y/x} aspect ratio}
\item{width}{numeric; the width of the plotting window canvas in inches}
\item{ppi}{integer; screen resolution in points per inch}
\item{cex.pts}{numeric; the amount by which point symbols should be magnified relative to the default.}
\item{mouseMode}{character; a vector of 3 strings describing what the 3 mouse buttons do, see \code{par3d}}
\item{bg}{character; the primary color for the background}
}

\details{
The interpolated surface data is rendered using \pkg{rgl}, a \acronym{3D} 
visualization device system for \R based on OpenGL. 
The mouse is used for interactive viewpoint navigation where
the left, right, and center mouse buttons rotate the scene, rotate the scene around 
the x-axis, and zooms the display, respectively.
